Getting help
============

If you need help with the PortableApps.com Launcher, there are a few ways you
can get help:

* You can find people who might help in our `IRC chat room`_. You are most
  likely to get help from Chris Morgan, the author and maintainer of the
  PortableApps.com Launcher. I'm regularly in IRC and use the nick
  *ChrisMorgan*. If I'm not there other people may also be able to help you or
  at least point you in the right direction.

* For a more complex question, or if no-one can help you in IRC, you can ask for
  help in the forums_.

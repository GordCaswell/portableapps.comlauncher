=============================================
PortableApps.com Launcher 2.2 release notes
=============================================

This release improves the runtime state saving mechanism which was introduced
in version 2.1, to improve stability and decrease the probability of portable
apps getting stuck in a non-functional state which could occasionally happen.
No new features have been added and there will be no apparent changes to normal
portable app developers.

Changes
=======

Mutex-based starting/stopping checks
------------------------------------

The starting/stopping checks introduced in 2.1 were switched from using the
RuntimeData INI file to using mutexes. This change allows system-wide blocking
of apps in those phases, where the current method works installation-wide,
i.e. it will not work if you run the same app from different directories.

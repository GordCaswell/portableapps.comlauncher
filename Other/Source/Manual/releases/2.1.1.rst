PortableApps.com Launcher 2.1.1 release notes
=============================================

This release is the first bug-fix release for the 2.1 line and incidentally the
first bug-fix release for the PortableApps.com Launcher as a whole.

For more information about the 2.1 release, see :ref:`releases-2.1`.

Bugs fixed
==========

Tertiary launches don't work
----------------------------

One of the new features in 2.1 is detection of an already-starting instance of
the portable app, which formerly could lead to data corruption. However, the
"starting" flag was set for secondary launches, and so tertiary launches would
fail to run while any instances were still running (depending slightly on the
app configuration).

Further details are available in the `bug report`_.

Runtime data file left behind on host machine for secondary launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While investigating the bug mentioned above, another minor problem was found -
a file ``runtimedata.ini`` was left behind in the plugin directory (which is a
subdirectory with a name like ``nsXXXXXX`` in the user's TEMP directory) for
all secondary instances. This has been fixed now.

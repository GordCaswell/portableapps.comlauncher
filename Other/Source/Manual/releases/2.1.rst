PortableApps.com Launcher 2.1 release notes -- UNDER DEVELOPMENT
================================================================

The next version of the PortableApps.com Launcher is coming now! With `various
new features`_ and improved documentation, this release makes it easier than
ever to make portable apps.

.. _`various new features`: `New features`_

New features
============

Better support for varying operating systems
--------------------------------------------

This release introduces operating system compatibility detection, supporting a
minimum OS required to run, with :ini-key:`[Launch]:MinOS`, and a maximum
supported OS, with :ini-key:`[Launch]:MaxOS`.

This is handy in particular for apps which don't support Windows 2000; the
PortableApps.com Launcher itself doesn't support Windows 95, 98 or Me (due to
its being Unicode), but it does support Windows 2000, and some apps, like Google
Chrome or the GIMP, don't work on Windows 2000. Rather than failing silently,
it's more helpful to warn the user -- so a line ``MinOS=2000`` is very helpful
for the user.
 
There are also some more values added to supplement
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin`, to provide operating system dependant privilege
requirement. This may be useful in particular for some apps which before Vista
didn't need administrative privileges, but for Vista and later need
administrative privileges due to the tightened security and UAC subsystem.

These added values are
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin2000`,
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdminXP`,
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin2003`,
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdminVista`,
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin2008`,
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin7` and
:ini-key:`[Launch]:RunAsAdmin2008R2`.

DLL server registration
-----------------------

Some apps register DLL servers (keyword: DllRegisterServer); this leaves data in
the registry. To take care of this, a new INI section has been added,
:ini-section:`[RegisterDLL]`, to take care of this.

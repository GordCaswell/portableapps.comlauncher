Files and directories
=====================

One of the most common things with making applications portable is moving
settings around. Ideally, an application is able to be made portable (or at
least almost portable) with a command-line option or an environment variable to
set its settings location, but most applications don't support this. (TODO: a
discussion of ways to improve base applications is in order.)

Until I write more content in here, you should refer to the documentation for
the :ini-section:`[FilesMove]`, :ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]`,
:ini-section:`[DirectoriesCleanupIfEmpty]` and
:ini-section:`[DirectoriesCleanupForce]` sections of launcher.ini.
